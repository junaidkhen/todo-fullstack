# Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

## Overview
Spec-Driven Development is a methodology that prioritizes creating detailed specifications before implementation, ensuring clear requirements, architectural decisions, and implementation plans are documented and agreed upon before writing code.

## Key Principles
- **Specification First**: Write comprehensive specs before coding
- **Architecture Planning**: Design system architecture with clear decision records
- **Task Breakdown**: Convert specifications into actionable, testable tasks
- **Traceability**: Maintain links between specs, plans, tasks, and implementation

## Application in This Project
- Feature specifications in `specs/<feature>/spec.md`
- Architecture decisions in `specs/<feature>/plan.md`
- Implementation tasks in `specs/<feature>/tasks.md`
- Prompt History Records (PHR) for complete development traceability

## Benefits
- Reduces ambiguity and rework
- Improves team alignment and communication
- Creates audit trail for decisions
- Enables better project planning and estimation
