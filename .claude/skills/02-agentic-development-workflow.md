# Agentic Development Workflow (Claude Code, AI Agents)

## Overview
Leveraging AI agents and Claude Code to automate and accelerate software development workflows through intelligent task execution, code generation, and development assistance.

## Key Components
- **Claude Code CLI**: Interactive AI-powered development assistant
- **Specialized Agents**: Domain-specific agents (product-architect, spec-engineer, fastapi-backend-engineer, nextjs-frontend-engineer, security-auth-guardian)
- **Agent Orchestration**: Coordinating multiple agents for complex workflows
- **Context Management**: Maintaining development context across sessions

## Application in This Project
- Using Claude Code for implementation guidance
- Specialized agents for architecture, backend, frontend, and security
- Automated PHR creation for knowledge capture
- AI-assisted code review and testing

## Benefits
- Accelerated development cycles
- Consistent code quality and patterns
- Reduced cognitive load on developers
- Better documentation through automated capture
