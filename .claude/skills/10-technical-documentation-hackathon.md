# Technical Documentation & Hackathon Readiness

## Overview
Creating comprehensive, clear technical documentation that effectively communicates project architecture, features, and implementation details for hackathon presentations, team collaboration, and future maintenance.

## Key Documentation Components
- **README**: Project overview, setup instructions, features
- **Architecture Diagrams**: System design visualization
- **API Documentation**: Endpoint specifications and examples
- **Specifications**: Feature requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Prompt History Records (PHR)**: Development decision history
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADR)**: Significant technical decisions

## Application in This Project
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- Feature specifications in `specs/` directory
- Architecture documentation in plan files
- PHR records in `history/prompts/`
- Code comments for complex logic
- API endpoint documentation

## Hackathon-Specific Documentation
- **Project Pitch**: Clear problem statement and solution
- **Demo Script**: Step-by-step demonstration flow
- **Technical Highlights**: Key innovations and technologies
- **Setup Guide**: Quick start for judges/reviewers
- **Video Demo**: Screen recording of functionality
- **Presentation Slides**: Visual summary of project

## Best Practices
- Write for different audiences (judges, developers, users)
- Include visual aids (diagrams, screenshots, GIFs)
- Provide working examples and test data
- Document known limitations honestly
- Keep installation steps simple and clear
- Include troubleshooting section
- Make code examples copy-pasteable
- Update documentation as project evolves

## Hackathon Presentation Tips
- Start with the problem, not the technology
- Show live demo early in presentation
- Highlight technical challenges overcome
- Explain unique innovations
- Demonstrate scalability and future potential
- Practice timing (usually 3-5 minutes)
- Prepare backup plan if live demo fails
